# Blackjack-using-Python

This is a simple blackjack card game which uses Python Tkinter. All the cards are provided in .png format.
RULES:
  Numbered cards are worth the corresponding number indicated on the card. Face cards are worth 10, except for the Ace, which is worth 1  or 11. The most important blackjack rule is simple: beat the dealer's hand without going over 21. If you get 21 points exactly on the deal, that is called a blackjack. The player is dealt two cards initially. And the next cards decides the winner.
